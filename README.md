## About
This repository contains the code and implementation details of the Paper Review assignment for the CS6208 course. In this assignment, we review Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN), with an application on a movie recommendation scenarios.

### Background
Collaborative filtering is a traditional technique for solving user-specific recommendation problems, but it has several drawbacks, such as the sparsity of user-item interactions. [(Wang et al., 2018)]() and [(Huang et al., 2018)]() have used knowledge graphs (KG) to overcome these issues, which are heterogeneous graphs with nodes/edges representing item attributes/relations and build feature- and connection-rich scenarios to improve precision. Graph neural networks, specifically graph convolutional networks (GCN), have become powerful tools for processing such data. [(Wang et al., 2019)]() combined KG and GCN in recommendation systems to achieve good performance on multiple datasets. This assignment reviews this knowledge graph convolutional network (K-GCN) through a user-specific movie recommendation problem.
